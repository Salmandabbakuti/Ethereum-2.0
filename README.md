## Content
## 1.Proof-of-stake(Casper):-
Proof-of-stake is a family of consensus protocols that uses cryptocurrency deposits to secure the blockchain. It requires validators to propose and vote on new blocks of transactions. Validators are rewarded with interest on their deposits if they follow the protocol’s rules. If they act dishonestly their deposits are penalised.
## 2.Sharding:-
dividing a blockchain network into several smaller component networks (called shards) capable of processing transactions in parallel — is considered to be a promising way to achieve high throughputs comparable to the thousands of transactions per second of traditional payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard.
## 3.e-wasm:-
eWASM is being developed as a replacement to the EVM. eWASM is based on the WASM (WebAssembly) instruction-set which is designed as an open standard by a W3C Community Group and is actively being developed by engineers from Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
eWASM will make a significant difference to how many transactions can be processed and subsequently added to a block — further increasing transaction throughput.
If eWASM executes 2x faster, then 2x more transactions can be put into a block.
